Subjectivity: The starting point of this model is the idea that consciousness is fundamentally subjective. Phenomenological elements are added to consider the relationship between subjective experience and objective phenomena.

Relation to Matter: Specifies how consciousness is related to matter, particularly the brain and nervous system. This is a point of intersection between science and philosophy, and much research is still being conducted.

Continuity: This part addresses how consciousness is experienced over time. This is a philosophical question, and debates on the truth of its continuity are ongoing.

Content: Categorizes what consciousness holds, such as sensation, emotion, thought, and intent.

Self-Consciousness: Discusses how one places oneself within the realm of their own consciousness, also mentioning the concepts and terminology.

Conscious and Unconscious: Considers the relationship between conscious and unconscious elements. This affects not only psychology but also culture and society.

Fluctuations: Examines how consciousness changes based on different states or environments, such as sleep, dreams, and meditation.

Semiotics, Post-Structuralism, Realism, Epistemology: These elements are added from modern philosophical perspectives. The understanding of consciousness is also dependent on cultural, social, and philosophical backgrounds.
