Translated Meta Symbols
Meta-symbolization is a method of representing normal symbols or concepts at a higher level of abstraction. In this context, "meta-symbolizing the elements of the consciousness model" means representing each element in a more generalized, abstracted, or explicit form in relation to other elements.

Here are the meta-symbolized elements:

Subjectivity (Σ₁)
Definition (δ₁)
Knowledge Acquisition (κ₁)
Limitation (λ₁)
Relation to Matter (Σ₂)
Interfacing Area (μ₂)
Current State (ν₂)
Continuity (Σ₃)
Sensation (σ₃)
Speculation (κ₃)
Content (Σ₄)
Types (τ₄)
Self-Awareness (Σ₅)
Ability (α₅)
Terminology (γ₅)
Conscious and Unconscious (Σ₆)
Range of Consciousness (ρ₆)
Range of Unconsciousness (ψ₆)
Variability (Σ₇)
Factors of Change (φ₇)
Factors of Change upon Re-experiencing (χ₇)
By using these meta-symbols, it becomes easier to generalize their relationships. For example, you can use these meta-symbols to express general relationships:

Σ₁ ∼ Σ₂ (Subjectivity is related to matter in some way)
Σ₃ → Σ₄ (Continuity has an effect on content)
